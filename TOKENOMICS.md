# 📊 TOKENOMICS – KnowledgeMint Protocol

## 🎯 Purpose of the Token

The KnowledgeMint protocol introduces a native utility token called **$KMINT**, which serves as the core economic unit to:

- Incentivize contribution of valuable **KnowledgeObjects** and **ProblemObjects**
- Reward curators, reviewers, and validators (AI-assisted or human)
- Facilitate governance and protocol upgrades
- Enable staking for AI evaluation access and knowledge markets

## 🪙 Token Utility

| Use Case                             | Description |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| 🎁 **Contributor Rewards**           | Users receive $KMINT for accepted knowledge/problem submissions. |
| 🧠 **Staking for Evaluation Access** | Researchers or orgs stake tokens to prioritize evaluation of high-value submissions. |
| 👥 **Governance Voting**             | Token holders vote on protocol changes, AI parameters, and incentive structure. |
| 🧰 **Infrastructure Funding**        | Treasury allocates $KMINT to bounties, R&D, or partner integrations. |
| 🔍 **Peer Review Incentives**        | (Optional) Future human-in-the-loop peer review process can be token-incentivized. |

## 🏦 Token Distribution (Initial Proposal)

| Category              | Allocation | Vesting Schedule |
|-----------------------|------------|------------------|
| 🧑‍🎓 Contributors     | 40%        | Continuous minting per object |
| 🔬 R&D / Core Dev      | 20%        | 12-month cliff, 36-month vest |
| 🌱 Ecosystem Grants    | 15%        | As approved by DAO |
| 🧠 Community Reserve   | 15%        | Held by treasury, DAO-governed |
| 💼 Founding Team       | 10%        | 18-month cliff, 48-month vest |

## 🔥 Minting & Emission Policy

- **No pre-mine**, no PoW or PoS.
- New tokens are minted **exclusively** in exchange for accepted knowledge/problem objects.
- Minting volume is **algorithmically throttled** via a dynamic AI-determined valuation score.

**Anti-inflation mechanism**:
- A decay rate applies to token issuance if weekly submission volume exceeds quality-adjusted caps.
- Future DAO may vote to introduce token-burning for low-quality or outdated objects.

---

## 🗳 DAO Governance

KnowledgeMint will be governed by a DAO with voting rights tied to $KMINT holdings.

DAO will manage:
- Treasury distribution
- AI model updates and thresholds
- Curation incentives
- Whitelisting of knowledge domains or review experts

---

## 🌍 Long-Term Vision

$KMINT is not just a reward token—it represents a **unit of epistemic value**. Over time, it can underpin a decentralized, knowledge-based economy including:

- Research funding marketplaces
- Decentralized peer review systems
- Knowledge-to-AI alignment channels
- Public-good knowledge DAOs
