== Milestones

The implementation of KnowledgeMint on Polkadot is divided into the following major milestones:

=== Milestone 1: Prototype AI Verifier & Web Gateway

- Build and deploy basic web interface for uploading data.
- Implement AI Verifier service with basic scoring logic.
- No blockchain integration yet; simulate minting.
- Output: Usable prototype for internal testing.

=== Milestone 2: KMINT Token Deployment

- Decide on parachain model (custom or smart contract).
- Implement and deploy KMINT token contract/pallet.
- Provide wallet integration in the UI.
- Output: Token is mintable and usable via Polkadot.

=== Milestone 3: Full AI â†’ Blockchain Pipeline

- Integrate AI Verifier and Minting Service with token logic.
- Test minting via actual token issuance.
- Store hash of uploaded data in chain (optional).
- Output: End-to-end data-to-token flow.

=== Milestone 4: Knowledge Access Billing

- Implement Access Billing service.
- Enable querying AI and knowledge base with KMINT payments.
- Output: Users can spend tokens to access value.

=== Milestone 5: Audit, Docs, and Public Testnet

- Finalize documentation.
- Perform security and logic audit.
- Deploy to public Polkadot testnet.
- Output: Open MVP ready for public feedback.
