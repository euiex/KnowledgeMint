= SPEC-6: Wallet Security and Safe Signing Practices
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Problem Statement

Users interact with the KnowledgeMint protocol via browser wallets (e.g., Polkadot.js, Talisman), which introduce risks such as:

- Transaction hijacking or phishing
- Replay of signed messages
- Unclear transaction intent for the user
- Exposure of sensitive metadata

== Goals

- Prevent unauthorized transactions and message reuse
- Ensure user understands what they are signing
- Protect against frontend injection or spoofing
- Establish a verifiable signing and verification model

== Security Guidelines

=== 1. Sign Only Meaningful Payloads

Avoid signing raw strings or unclear hashes. Use structured messages like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "mint_request",
  "user": "0xabc...",
  "knowledge_id": "k-123",
  "score": 0.85,
  "nonce": "78923983",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-12T11:00:00Z"
}
----

=== 2. Use Nonces and Timestamps

Every message must include:

- `nonce`: unique per session or action
- `timestamp`: ISO UTC time
- Backend must verify freshness and uniqueness

=== 3. Display Clear Intent to User

Always show:
- Purpose: e.g. "Sign to request AI query access"
- Resource ID
- Token amount involved
- Expiration (if any)

=== 4. Signature Verification

Backend or smart contract must:

- Verify public address via signature
- Check nonce/timestamp validity
- Match expected schema

=== 5. Secure Channels

- Use only `https://` connections
- Never send private keys or seed phrases
- Do not allow signing from iframe-untrusted origins

=== 6. Compatibility Notes

Polkadot.js supports JSON payloads signing via:

```javascript
signer.signRaw({
  address,
  data: stringToHex(payload),
  type: 'bytes'
})
