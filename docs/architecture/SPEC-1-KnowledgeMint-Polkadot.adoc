= SPEC-1: KnowledgeMint on Polkadot
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

KnowledgeMint is a cryptographic protocol where artificial intelligence issues cryptocurrency in exchange for valuable knowledge provided by users. When users upload structured or verified data, they receive rewards in the form of tokens.

The AI is responsible for the emission and distribution of tokens but does not manage the blockchain itself. Instead, all on-chain logic is handled by Polkadot’s ecosystem, leveraging its scalable, modular infrastructure through Substrate.

The move to Polkadot is motivated by:
- Interoperability with other chains and systems.
- Ability to isolate token logic in a custom parachain or smart contract.
- Upgradeability and flexibility through Substrate’s runtime modules.

== Requirements

=== Must-Have

1. Users must be able to upload data to the system.
2. AI must automatically assess the value of submitted data.
3. AI must trigger token minting upon validating the data.
4. The system must log the token issuance on the Polkadot chain.
5. Users must have access to a wallet for managing tokens.
6. All transactions must be verifiable and auditable on-chain.
7. KnowledgeMint tokens must be usable for accessing AI services and knowledge.

=== Should-Have

1. A web-based interface for data upload and interaction with the AI.
2. Logging or audit system to trace AI validation decisions.
3. Token implementation using standard interfaces (e.g., PSP22 for Substrate).
4. Dashboard metrics on knowledge volume and token issuance.

=== Could-Have

1. Reputation system for users contributing high-value data.
2. Appeal mechanism for AI decisions.
3. DAO governance using the KnowledgeMint token.
4. NFT certificates for data ownership or authorship.

== Method

=== System Overview

The system includes the following components:

1. AI Verifier – Evaluates uploaded knowledge and determines its reward value.
2. Minting Service – Interacts with the blockchain to issue KMINT tokens.
3. Polkadot Parachain / Smart Contracts – Manages balances and token logic.
4. Knowledge Gateway – Web interface for data upload, wallet, and AI access.
5. Wallet Integration – Allows users to manage KMINT tokens.
6. Off-chain Data Store – Stores user-submitted data for AI evaluation and access.
7. Access Billing Service – Handles token-based payments for knowledge and AI services.
