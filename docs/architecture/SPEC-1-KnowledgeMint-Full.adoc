= SPEC-1: KnowledgeMint on Polkadot (Full Spec)
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

KnowledgeMint is a cryptographic protocol where artificial intelligence issues cryptocurrency in exchange for valuable knowledge provided by users. When users upload structured or verified data, they receive rewards in the form of tokens.

The AI is responsible for the emission and distribution of tokens but does not manage the blockchain itself. Instead, all on-chain logic is handled by Polkadot’s ecosystem, leveraging its scalable, modular infrastructure through Substrate.

The move to Polkadot is motivated by:
- Interoperability with other chains and systems.
- Ability to isolate token logic in a custom parachain or smart contract.
- Upgradeability and flexibility through Substrate’s runtime modules.

== Requirements

=== Must-Have

1. Users must be able to upload data to the system.
2. AI must automatically assess the value of submitted data.
3. AI must trigger token minting upon validating the data.
4. The system must log the token issuance on the Polkadot chain.
5. Users must have access to a wallet for managing tokens.
6. All transactions must be verifiable and auditable on-chain.
7. KnowledgeMint tokens must be usable for accessing AI services and knowledge.

=== Should-Have

1. A web-based interface for data upload and interaction with the AI.
2. Logging or audit system to trace AI validation decisions.
3. Token implementation using standard interfaces (e.g., PSP22 for Substrate).
4. Dashboard metrics on knowledge volume and token issuance.

=== Could-Have

1. Reputation system for users contributing high-value data.
2. Appeal mechanism for AI decisions.
3. DAO governance using the KnowledgeMint token.
4. NFT certificates for data ownership or authorship.

== Method

=== System Overview

The system includes the following components:

1. AI Verifier – Evaluates uploaded knowledge and determines its reward value.
2. Minting Service – Interacts with the blockchain to issue KMINT tokens.
3. Polkadot Parachain / Smart Contracts – Manages balances and token logic.
4. Knowledge Gateway – Web interface for data upload, wallet, and AI access.
5. Wallet Integration – Allows users to manage KMINT tokens.
6. Off-chain Data Store – Stores user-submitted data for AI evaluation and access.
7. Access Billing Service – Handles token-based payments for knowledge and AI services.

== Implementation

The implementation will proceed in modular stages to separate blockchain logic, AI functionality, and user interaction. The following components should be developed and deployed sequentially:

=== 1. Token Smart Contract / Substrate Runtime Module

- Implement PSP22-compatible token or custom pallet.
- Expose mint/burn/transfer functions and events.

=== 2. AI Verifier Service

- REST API microservice (Python/Rust).
- Score incoming knowledge.
- Trigger token minting when approved.

=== 3. Minting Service

- Middleware that handles signed transactions to the chain.
- Connects AI Verifier → Blockchain.

=== 4. Knowledge Gateway

- Web app (React + Tailwind).
- Upload, feedback, wallet, and AI access UI.

=== 5. Off-chain Knowledge Store

- Use IPFS or Substrate’s off-chain workers.
- Store data, link to rewards and user ID.

=== 6. Billing Service

- Deduct KMINT tokens when accessing data or AI.
- Smart contract or Substrate integration.

== Milestones

=== Milestone 1: Prototype AI Verifier & Web Gateway

- Upload + Score + Simulated Minting.

=== Milestone 2: KMINT Token Deployment

- Implement token and connect wallet.

=== Milestone 3: Full AI → Blockchain Pipeline

- End-to-end data to token flow.

=== Milestone 4: Knowledge Access Billing

- Users pay KMINT for queries/data access.

=== Milestone 5: Audit, Docs, and Public Testnet

- Testnet release with monitoring.

== Gathering Results

=== 1. Requirement Validation

- Acceptance testing against Must-Haves.

=== 2. AI Evaluation Metrics

- Score precision, abuse resistance, throughput.

=== 3. Token Utility Tracking

- Velocity, spend patterns, retention.

=== 4. User Feedback

- Surveys, UX metrics, GitHub engagement.

=== 5. Testnet Monitoring

- Track transaction issues and logic bugs.
