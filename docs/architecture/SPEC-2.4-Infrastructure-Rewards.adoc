= SPEC-2.4: Infrastructure Rewards Architecture
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Purpose

To ensure sustainability and decentralization, the system must reward contributors of infrastructure resources with KMINT tokens. This document outlines the architecture for compensating:

- Compute providers (for AI evaluation or hosting)
- Storage nodes (e.g., IPFS, off-chain databases)
- Blockchain operators (validators, collators)

== Reward Types

=== Compute Resource Rewards

- Triggered by actual AI processing jobs completed.
- Measured in GPU/CPU-time consumed.
- Metered by internal billing microservice or external provider (e.g., GPU agent).

=== Storage Rewards

- Based on amount of data stored (in GB) and duration.
- Periodically measured via storage audit job or IPFS pinning service.
- Penalize for lost/unavailable chunks.

=== Blockchain Operation Rewards

- For validators/collators in case of custom parachain.
- If deployed on Moonbeam or shared parachain, rewards may go to RPC oracles and infrastructure maintainers.

== Components

1. **Resource Monitor Agent**

- Monitors actual resource usage (CPU/GPU, disk)
- Publishes metrics to Billing Service or Reward Engine

2. **Reward Engine**

- Computes per-period rewards per resource provider
- Issues signed reward payload to Minting Service

3. **Minting Service**

- Mints KMINT tokens to the provider's address
- Tags transaction as "infrastructure-reward"

== Example Reward Payload

[source,json]
----
{
  "provider_id": "infra-001",
  "type": "compute",
  "period": "2025-04",
  "usage_metric": {
    "gpu_hours": 62.5
  },
  "reward_tokens": 480.0
}
----

== Security & Validation

- Use cryptographic signatures from resource monitors to prevent spoofing
- Scheduled audits for data availability and compute integrity
- Future: integrate reputation and staking to improve trust

== Governance Notes

- Reward logic should be upgradable (e.g., via DAO proposal)
- KMINT tokenomics must reserve a portion of supply for infrastructure incentives
