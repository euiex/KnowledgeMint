= SPEC-2.5: Access Billing API
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Overview

The Access Billing Service processes token-based payments from users who wish to:

- Access valuable knowledge objects
- Query the AI model
- Use advanced features of the Knowledge Gateway

All payments are conducted in KMINT tokens and recorded on-chain or logged off-chain for lightweight use cases.

== Use Cases

- Viewing a premium knowledge object
- Submitting a high-load AI prompt
- Requesting a bulk export or dataset

== API Design

=== Endpoint: `/api/pay`

.Processes a payment for a specific resource or action.

.Method: POST
.Format: JSON

.Request:
[source,json]
----
{
  "user_address": "0xabc123...",
  "resource_type": "ai_query",
  "resource_id": "query-8792",
  "price_kmint": 2.5
}
----

.Response:
[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "success",
  "tx_hash": "0xdeadbeef...",
  "resource_access_granted": true
}
----

.Status Codes:
- `200 OK`: Payment accepted and access granted
- `402 Payment Required`: Insufficient tokens
- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Invalid resource or input

== Internal Flow

1. Validates user balance (on-chain or via Wallet Service)
2. Deducts KMINT tokens (via blockchain transaction or internal escrow)
3. Logs access and grants permission

== Billing Modes

- **On-chain mode**: actual KMINT tokens moved between user and system address
- **Off-chain mode**: deduction tracked internally (for subscriptions or testnet)

== Future Enhancements

- Rate-based billing (e.g., per token or per kilobyte of output)
- Dynamic pricing per resource category
- Refund logic in case of service failure

== Security

- Validate ownership of `user_address` via wallet signature
- Prevent double-spending via nonce tracking or chain state
- Optionally add access tokens or vouchers
