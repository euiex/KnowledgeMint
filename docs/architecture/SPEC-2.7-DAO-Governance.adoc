= SPEC-2.7: DAO Governance and Voting System
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Overview

To ensure transparency and decentralized control over the KnowledgeMint protocol, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) will be implemented. It allows KMINT token holders to:

- Propose and vote on upgrades
- Adjust protocol parameters (e.g., rewards, fees)
- Allocate ecosystem funding (e.g., grants, bounties)
- Curate high-quality knowledge

== Governance Model

The DAO will be based on KMINT token-weighted voting:

- 1 KMINT = 1 vote (with optional quadratic scaling in future)
- Voting power is linked to on-chain wallet balance (or staked tokens)
- Delegation is supported (optional)

== Components

1. **Proposal Registry**

- Smart contract or chain module to register proposals
- Each proposal has: title, description, proposer, start/end time

2. **Voting Engine**

- On-chain logic to accept and count votes
- Support for "yes", "no", and "abstain"
- Voting window configurable per proposal

3. **Execution System**

- Proposals with quorum and majority can trigger:
  - Parameter updates (via runtime API or governance contract)
  - Fund transfers from treasury
  - Upgrade deployments (via governance runtime call)

== Example Proposal

[source,json]
----
{
  "title": "Increase token reward for knowledge from 10 â†’ 15 KMINT",
  "description": "To incentivize high-quality data contributors",
  "proposer": "0xabc123",
  "start_time": "2025-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-05-07T00:00:00Z"
}
----

== Voting API

(Optionally exposed via backend service or dApp)

.POST /api/vote
[source,json]
----
{
  "proposal_id": "42",
  "voter_address": "0xuser123",
  "vote": "yes"
}
----

== Security

- All proposals are immutable once submitted
- Votes are signed and validated against chain state
- Anti-spam: Proposal threshold or staking required to propose

== Future Enhancements

- Quadratic voting to prevent whale domination
- Token-locking to prevent flash voting
- Reputation-based governance layer

== Notes

- DAO logic may be implemented via Substrate pallets or smart contracts (e.g., OpenGov on Moonbeam)
- Frontend should allow exploring and voting on proposals with connected wallet
