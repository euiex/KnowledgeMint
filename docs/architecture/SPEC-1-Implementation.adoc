= SPEC-1: Implementation Plan for KnowledgeMint

:toc:

== Implementation

The implementation will proceed in modular stages to separate blockchain logic, AI functionality, and user interaction. The following components should be developed and deployed sequentially:

=== 1. Token Smart Contract / Substrate Runtime Module

- If using Moonbeam or another smart contract parachain:
  - Implement a PSP22-compatible smart contract for `KMINT` token.
  - Expose mint/burn/transfer functions and necessary events.
- If using a custom parachain:
  - Develop a runtime pallet in Substrate to manage balances and minting authorization.
  - Add hooks for the Minting Service to call the runtime via RPC or off-chain workers.

=== 2. AI Verifier Service

- Develop a Python or Rust-based microservice.
- Accept JSON documents (structured knowledge) via REST API.
- Use scoring algorithms to determine the usefulness of uploaded knowledge.
- Send minting requests to the Minting Service upon approval.

=== 3. Minting Service

- REST API or internal service that interfaces with blockchain (smart contract or parachain node).
- Receives token issuance requests from AI Verifier.
- Validates and forwards transaction calls to the blockchain.
- Optionally logs all issuance events for audit purposes.

=== 4. Knowledge Gateway (Web Interface)

- Web app (React + Tailwind recommended).
- Features:
  - Data upload interface (file or form-based)
  - AI feedback display (approval, score, token value)
  - Wallet view (balance, transactions)
  - Access to AI query interface

=== 5. Off-chain Knowledge Store

- Store uploaded data (optionally hashed on-chain for verification).
- Prefer IPFS or Substrateâ€™s off-chain storage.
- Ensure each knowledge object is linked with user and reward metadata.

=== 6. Billing Service for Access

- Handles micropayments in KMINT for:
  - Access to knowledge objects
  - Queries to AI services
- Ensures token deduction via smart contract or runtime logic.
