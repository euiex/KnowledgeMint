= SPEC-4: Tokenomics Model and Separation of Concerns
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Problem Statement

KMINT currently serves multiple roles within the KnowledgeMint ecosystem:

- A reward token for knowledge contributors
- A utility token for AI access and data retrieval
- A currency for infrastructure payouts (compute/storage)
- A governance token for DAO voting

This leads to potential confusion in valuation, logic complexity, and security risks.

== Design Goals

- Clear economic separation of functions
- Minimal friction for users and contributors
- Scalable reward and billing infrastructure
- DAO compatibility

== Solution: Modular Token Roles

The KMINT ecosystem will define **three token roles**, each handled via dedicated modules or contracts:

=== 1. Reward Token (KMINT)

- Native Substrate balance token or PSP22
- Minted by the Minting Service when AI verifies valuable knowledge
- Received by knowledge contributors and infrastructure providers
- Stored in user wallet and transferable

=== 2. Billing Token Logic

- KMINT is used to pay for:
  - AI queries
  - Premium content access
- Handled via a **Billing Contract** or **runtime pallet**
- Deducts KMINT from wallet and emits events
- May lock tokens temporarily or burn depending on policy

=== 3. Governance Module

- Same KMINT token balance grants voting rights
- Voting handled by on-chain module (e.g. OpenGov or custom DAO pallet)
- Optionally, require staked tokens for proposal rights

== Optional Extension: Subtokens / Wrapping

In the future, if ecosystem complexity increases, the following options are possible:

- Wrap KMINT into:
  - **gKMINT** for governance (locked for voting)
  - **bKMINT** for billing with time-based decay
- Separate **infraKMINT** for resource providers only

== Security & UX Notes

- Frontend should clearly display:
  - Available KMINT balance
  - What actions cost tokens
  - Governance power and rewards history
- All roles must share a common ledger (avoid duplication)
- Minting and burning policies must be consistent and auditable

== Summary

| Function             | Mechanism             | Module/Contract         |
|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Knowledge Reward     | Mint KMINT            | Minting Service + Chain |
| AI/Data Access       | Pay KMINT             | Billing API/Contract    |
| Infra Compensation   | Mint KMINT            | Infra Engine + Chain    |
| DAO Voting           | Use KMINT as vote     | Governance Module       |
