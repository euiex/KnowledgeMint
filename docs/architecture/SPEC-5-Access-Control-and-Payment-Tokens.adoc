= SPEC-5: Access Control and Post-Payment Validation
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Problem Statement

The current billing model processes token deductions when users access AI services or knowledge, but lacks a standardized way to enforce access after payment. This opens risks such as:

- Unauthorized access if token deduction fails silently
- Replay attacks using the same request
- Ambiguity over time-limited access vs. permanent unlock

== Goals

- Ensure that only users who paid can access protected resources
- Enable reusable or expirable access
- Ensure traceability and security of payments
- Avoid blockchain overload for frequent, low-cost actions

== Solution: Payment Tokens for Access Control

When a payment is completed, the system issues a **signed Access Token** to the client. This token is then used to retrieve content or invoke AI.

=== Access Token Structure

[source,json]
----
{
  "access_token": "JWT or HMAC",
  "resource_id": "ai-query-888",
  "expires_at": "2025-05-01T18:30:00Z",
  "issued_to": "0xabc123",
  "proof_tx": "0xpaymentTxHash"
}
----

- Tokens may be stored client-side or server-side
- Can be single-use or session-limited
- Expiration timestamp is mandatory

=== Payment Flow with Access Control

1. User initiates payment via `/api/pay`
2. Billing system deducts KMINT and logs payment
3. A signed access token is returned
4. User sends this token with future `/api/access` or `/api/query` requests
5. Token is verified before granting access

== Security Model

- Access tokens must be signed (HMAC or JWT using a trusted secret)
- Include timestamp and resource_id to prevent misuse
- Server must check token signature and expiration
- Optionally: replay protection via nonce or token ID

== Smart Contract Notes

If using on-chain enforcement:

- Payment logs can emit events (e.g., `AccessGranted(user, resourceId, txHash)`)
- Off-chain services can sync this data and issue access

== Future Enhancements

- Token scopes (e.g., read-only vs. interactive)
- Rate-limited access (e.g., X queries per minute)
- Group access (e.g., via DAO roles or subscription tiers)
