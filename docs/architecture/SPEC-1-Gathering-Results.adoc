== Gathering Results

To evaluate the success of the KnowledgeMint system, the following metrics and feedback mechanisms will be used:

=== 1. Requirement Validation

Each requirement in the Must-Have section will be verified with acceptance tests:
- Token issuance for knowledge uploads verified.
- Wallet integration functional.
- Transactions auditable via Polkadot explorers.
- AI correctly scores and responds to uploads.

=== 2. AI Evaluation Metrics

- Precision of scoring: Compare AI-assigned scores with expert-curated values.
- Abuse resistance: Measure how well the system resists spam or low-quality data.
- Throughput: Maximum number of evaluations and minting events per second.

=== 3. Token Utility Tracking

- Monitor KMINT token usage for:
  - Accessing the knowledge base.
  - Payments for AI interactions.
- Evaluate token velocity and retention in user wallets.

=== 4. User Feedback & Community Adoption

- Surveys and usage analytics to assess:
  - Ease of use (UI/UX).
  - Perceived fairness and transparency.
  - Willingness to contribute knowledge.
- Feedback from early adopters and community contributors (via testnet & GitHub).

=== 5. Public Testnet Logs and Issue Tracking

- Monitor all testnet deployments for:
  - Failed minting events.
  - Transaction delays or high fees.
  - Bugs in UI or logic.
- Use collected data to guide post-MVP improvements.
