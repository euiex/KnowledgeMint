== Gathering Results

To evaluate the success of the KnowledgeMint system, the following metrics and feedback mechanisms will be used:

=== 1. Requirement Validation

Each requirement in the Must-Have section will be verified with acceptance tests:

    Token issuance for knowledge uploads verified.

    Wallet integration functional.

    Transactions auditable via Polkadot explorers.

    AI correctly scores and responds to uploads.

=== 2. AI Evaluation Metrics

    Precision of scoring: Compare AI-assigned scores with expert-curated values (manually or statistically).

    Abuse resistance: Measure how well the system resists spam or low-quality data.

    Throughput: Max number of evaluations and minting events per second.

=== 3. Token Utility Tracking

    Monitor KMINT token usage for:

        Accessing knowledge base.

        Payments for AI interactions.

    Evaluate token velocity and retention in user wallets.

=== 4. User Feedback & Community Adoption

    Surveys and usage analytics to assess:

        Ease of use (UI/UX)

        Perceived fairness and transparency

        Willingness to contribute knowledge

    Feedback from early adopters and external contributors (via testnet & GitHub issues).

=== 5. Public Testnet Logs and Issue Tracking

    All testnet deployments will be monitored for:

        Failed minting events

        Transaction delays or costs

        Bugs in UI or logic

    Collected data will guide post-MVP improvements.
