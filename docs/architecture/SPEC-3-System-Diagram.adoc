:toc:

== Overview

This document provides a full visual overview of the KnowledgeMint architecture, including user flows, token flows, infrastructure contributions, and DAO-based governance. The diagram helps contributors and developers understand the relationships between all key modules.

== Component Key

- **User** – Knowledge contributor or AI user.
- **Provider** – Node operator, GPU provider, or storage host.
- **AI Verifier** – Evaluates value of submitted knowledge.
- **Minting Service** – Handles issuance of KMINT tokens.
- **Access Billing** – Processes payments for AI/data access.
- **Wallet Integration** – Manages token transfer and auth.
- **Infrastructure Engine** – Tracks and rewards resource usage.
- **DAO Governance** – Token-based community control system.

== How to Use

You can edit or expand this diagram to reflect changes in the protocol. It is especially useful for presentations, onboarding new developers, or drafting DAO proposals that affect system structure.
