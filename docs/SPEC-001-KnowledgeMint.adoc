== Method

The KnowledgeMint platform is built using a modular Web3 architecture that integrates blockchain-based smart contracts, decentralized storage (IPFS), and a frontend DApp interface. Below is the high-level component diagram:

=== Key Components

*Frontend DApp*
- Built with React or Next.js.
- Connects to user wallet via MetaMask.
- Uploads content to IPFS via web3.storage or Pinata.
- Calls smart contracts to mint NFTs.

*Smart Contracts*
- ERC-721-based NFT contract to represent knowledge modules.
- Proxy pattern used for upgradability (OpenZeppelin).
- Stores IPFS hash, author, and timestamp.

*IPFS Gateway*
- Upload interface to decentralized storage.
- Optionally uses dedicated pinning service for persistence.

*Off-chain Services (Optional)*
- Indexer that syncs new mints and builds search index.
- Tagging engine for categorizing modules.
