# 🧠 KnowledgeMint

**A decentralized AI-driven protocol that mints tokens not just for knowledge—but for problems too.**

> In KnowledgeMint, defining the right problem is as valuable as providing the right solution.

---

## 🌍 Overview

KnowledgeMint is an open crypto protocol where tokens are minted through contributions of verifiable knowledge **and** well-formulated problems. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining or passive staking, it leverages AI to assess the **epistemic value** of each contribution and mints tokens accordingly.

This creates a new economy where knowledge and inquiry are treated as real assets.

## 💡 What Makes KnowledgeMint Unique?

### 🧩 Problems as Valuable Assets
Most systems reward only solutions. KnowledgeMint uniquely recognizes that **formulating a good problem** is the first and often hardest step in innovation. Contributions of well-structured, high-impact problems are rewarded as **Problem Objects**.

### 🧠 AI as the Mint
AI models evaluate submissions based on:
- Originality
- Relevance
- Clarity
- Potential for discovery or application

### 🔗 Blockchain as Ledger
All minting events are transparently and immutably recorded on-chain, creating a citable, verifiable history of knowledge contributions.

## 🧠 Object Types

The system is centered around the concept of **Knowledge Objects**, defined in the [Knowledge Object Taxonomy](https://github.com/euiex/KnowledgeMint/blob/main/KNOWLEDGE_OBGECT_TAXONOMY.md):

- `ProblemObject`: A clearly defined problem statement with scope and context.
- `KnowledgeObject`: A verifiable contribution—e.g. a solution, theory, dataset, model, or insight.

Each object must adhere to specific formatting and metadata standards to be evaluated and tokenized.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

KnowledgeMint consists of the following main components:

### 1. 🧠 AI Minting Engine
- Receives submissions from users.
- Validates them using epistemic scoring models (custom LLMs).
- Triggers minting if thresholds are met.

### 2. 🔗 Blockchain Layer
- Stores immutable records of all contributions and token issuance.
- Serves as the base for staking, governance, and provenance.

### 3. 📦 Submission Interface
- A web-based UI and CLI tool for submitting objects.
- Object types are parsed, classified, and sent to the AI engine.

### 4. 📚 Metadata & Provenance
- Uses cryptographic object IDs and signatures.
- Tracks authorship and contribution lineage.
