# 🧠 KnowledgeMint

**AI-backed currency, minted for knowledge.**  
An open crypto protocol where tokens are issued not through energy consumption or staking, but in exchange for validated knowledge.

## 🌟 What is KnowledgeMint?

KnowledgeMint is a decentralized system that reimagines token minting: instead of mining or staking, tokens are created through the contribution of useful, novel, and validated knowledge.

AI serves as the impartial minting mechanism. It evaluates knowledge submissions—ranging from research data and models to problem solutions—and issues tokens accordingly.

The blockchain governs the economy. The AI is just the gatekeeper of what constitutes knowledge.
