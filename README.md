# KnowledgeMint

**AI-backed currency, minted for knowledge and innovation.**  
KnowledgeMint is a decentralized crypto protocol where tokens are **earned** by contributing validated, high-value knowledge — not through energy or capital staking.

## 🚀 What is KnowledgeMint?

KnowledgeMint transforms intellectual and technological breakthroughs into currency. AI evaluates submitted materials — research, problem-solving methods, 3D models, tech specs — and **mints tokens** when unique, useful knowledge is detected.

Unlike traditional AI, our system **takes an active role** in optimizing and accelerating innovation:
- 📊 Curates submitted insights
- 🧠 Helps develop new approaches
- 💸 Awards research grants via token issuance for outstanding work

Learn more in our [Whitepaper](./whitepaper.md) and [Glossary](./GLOSSARY.md).

We believe science and society suffer more from **misaligned focus** than lack of data.  
By linking tokens to **problem-solving and deep insight**, we aim to accelerate human progress.
