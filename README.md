# KnowledgeMint

**AI-backed currency, minted for knowledge.**  
KnowledgeMint is an open crypto protocol where tokens are not mined through energy or staking — but earned in exchange for validated, high-value knowledge.

Artificial Intelligence acts as a mint: it evaluates submitted content — 3D models, technical specs, research, or problem statements — and issues tokens when new, useful knowledge is detected.

These tokens are then freely exchanged on a decentralized blockchain. The AI is a curator, not a governor.

## Why KnowledgeMint?

Traditional cryptocurrencies reward energy consumption or capital lock-up.  
**KnowledgeMint rewards intellectual contribution and problem-solving.**

We believe that bottlenecks in science, technology, and society often result not from lack of data — but from insufficient attention to the *right* problems and unexplored insights.

By turning **knowledge** and **real-world challenges** into a currency, we incentivize the growth of collective intelligence.
