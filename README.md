# KnowledgeMint

**AI-backed currency, minted for knowledge.**  
An open crypto protocol where tokens are emitted not through energy or staking, but in exchange for validated knowledge.

## What is KnowledgeMint?

KnowledgeMint is a decentralized crypto system where artificial intelligence acts as a mint. It evaluates submitted data — like 3D models, technical specs, or scientific results — and issues tokens for high-value, novel knowledge.

The tokens are then freely exchanged on a blockchain, with no control from the AI. The AI is a curator, not a governor.

## 🌍 Open & Community Driven

This project is **100% open-source** and at an early stage. We're looking for:
- Engineers
