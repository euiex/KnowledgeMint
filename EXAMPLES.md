## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: How Anyone Can Contribute

At the early stage of the protocol, almost any structured and verifiable knowledge can earn tokens. Consider uploading:

- 3D scans of mechanical or biological objects  
- Annotated data files or experimental setups  
- Digitized lecture notes or technical manuals  
- Rare documentation from field research or labs  
- Video animations showing mechanisms or simulations

üí° The earlier you contribute, the more likely you are to gain visibility and rewards.
