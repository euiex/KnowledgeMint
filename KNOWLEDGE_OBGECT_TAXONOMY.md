# Knowledge Object Taxonomy & Problem-Centric Incentive Framework

Knowledge Object Taxonomy & Problem-Centric Incentive Framework

Overview

KnowledgeMint is a decentralized crypto protocol where artificial intelligence acts as a mint, evaluating submitted data—such as 3D models, technical specifications, or scientific results—and issuing tokens for high-value, novel knowledge. The tokens are then freely exchanged on a blockchain, with no control from the AI. The AI serves as a curator, not a governor.

This document outlines:
- A taxonomy of knowledge objects across various scientific and technological fields.
- The significance of problem identification, especially technological bottlenecks.
- Guidelines for contributors to structure and submit knowledge effectively.

1. Emphasizing Problem Identification

"We Buy Problems": Recognizing and articulating problems is as valuable as solving them. By identifying bottlenecks and challenges, we can direct collective intelligence towards meaningful solutions.

Types of Problems to Highlight:
- Technological Bottlenecks: Limitations hindering progress in specific technologies.
- Scientific Anomalies: Observations that deviate from established theories.
- Process Inefficiencies: Areas where current methods are suboptimal.
- Knowledge Gaps: Missing information critical for advancement.

2. Knowledge Object Taxonomy by Domain

Materials Science

- Phase Diagrams

- X-ray Diffraction Data

- Mechanical Testing Results

- Material Properties

- Synthesis Methods

- 3D Scans of Material Microstructures

Optics and Photonics

- Crystal Descriptions

- Growth Techniques

Note: This list is not exhaustive and should be continuously expanded as new types of knowledge emerge. Community contributions are essential to keeping the taxonomy relevant and comprehensive.

3. Submission Guidelines

To ensure consistency and facilitate AI evaluation:
- Title: Concise and descriptive.
- Abstract: Summary of the knowledge object.
- Domain: Relevant scientific or technological field.
- Keywords: Pertinent terms for indexing.
- Data Files: Attach relevant datasets, models, or documents.
- References: Cite sources and related work.
- Problem Statement (if applicable): Clearly define the issue addressed.

4. Integration into KnowledgeMint

This taxonomy and framework should be incorporated into the KnowledgeMint repository as a markdown file, ensuring accessibility and ease of updates. Suggested filename: knowledge_object_taxonomy.md.
