# KnowledgeMint Whitepaper

## 1. Introduction

In a world where value is created through energy (Proof-of-Work) or capital (Proof-of-Stake), KnowledgeMint introduces a third path: **Proof-of-Knowledge**.

This project proposes a mechanism where artificial intelligence (AI) acts as a mint, issuing crypto tokens in exchange for verified, valuable knowledge contributions.

## 2. Core Concept

AI plays a central, dynamic role in KnowledgeMint. It not only evaluates the novelty, usefulness, and justification of submitted knowledge, but also actively generates new concepts, improvements, and solutions based on existing data. It can propose new designs, suggest optimizations, create educational programs, and even assist in scientific theory formulation. AI is both a curator and an innovator, using its ability to process vast amounts of data to push the boundaries of human knowledge.

In addition to evaluating existing knowledge, KnowledgeMint also **actively buys problems**. If you’ve identified a bottleneck, an unsolved challenge, or a crucial missing piece in your field, we want to reward you for sharing it. Problems are just as valuable as solutions — they are the starting point for innovation.

### Examples of valuable submissions:

- A 3D model of an industrial component
- Spectral data of a new material
- Technical documentation for a novel device
- Scientific or educational content
- A well-defined scientific or engineering problem
- A technological bottleneck that hinders progress
- A research gap that blocks further development
- A conceptual contradiction within existing theories

In addition to knowledge artifacts like models or datasets, well-formulated problems can also be submitted and rewarded. These include bottlenecks in production, conceptual contradictions, unresolved questions, or data gaps that block further development. Such problem definitions stimulate innovation by highlighting areas where new knowledge is most needed. 

By contributing problems, you help direct research and innovation towards the areas that need attention the most. The AI will assess the importance and relevance of the problem, and if it meets the criteria, the submitter will receive KMNT tokens as a reward.

The AI does not control the blockchain and has no authority over the economy. It simply acts as a gateway for new tokens to enter the system — through knowledge.

## 3. Architecture

The system consists of three layers:

- **User interface** — web-based or CLI, used to submit knowledge
- **AI assessment engine** — evaluates content based on novelty, value, and justification
- **Blockchain layer** — stores balances, enables transactions, ensures transparency

## 4. Emission Flow

1. The user submits a knowledge artifact or a well-formulated problem
2. The AI analyzes the data across three axes:
    - **Novelty** — is this new or derivative?
    - **Usefulness** — can it be applied?
    - **Justification** — is it well-supported or sourced?
3. For problem submissions, the AI also evaluates:
    - **Clarity** — Is the problem well-defined and unambiguous?
    - **Impact** — Would solving it unlock progress or innovation?
    - **Urgency** — Is the problem currently blocking research or production?
4. If the artifact or problem passes evaluation, a minting transaction is created to issue KMNT tokens to the user's wallet

## 5. Blockchain Layer

The blockchain layer is decentralized and independent. The AI only observes and sends transactions to it.

Functions:
- Store user wallets and token balances
- Record minting history
- Facilitate exchange and smart contracts

The protocol can be built on existing platforms (e.g., Ethereum L2, Polygon, Arbitrum) or evolve into a custom chain.

## 6. Knowledge Evaluation Model

The AI uses a transparent, auditable scoring system:

- **Novelty** — cosine similarity, source comparison, model divergence
- **Utility** — NLP-based tagging and relevance detection
- **Justification** — citation graph analysis, redundancy filters

For problem submissions, additional criteria are used:

- **Clarity** — Is the problem well-defined and unambiguous?
- **Impact** — Would solving it unlock progress or innovation?
- **Urgency** — Is the problem currently blocking research or production?

The scoring rules are public and subject to improvement through DAO votes.

## 7. Tokenomics

- **Token:** KMNT (Knowledge Mint Token)
- Only mintable through validated knowledge submissions
- Emission capped per time unit to reduce inflation
- NFTs possible for unique contributions

## 8. Use Cases

The following are some examples of the types of contributions that can earn KMNT tokens. However, this is not an exhaustive list — the system is designed to reward any valuable, novel knowledge that contributes to technological or scientific advancement:

- An engineer submits a 3D printable model of a custom gear → receives KMNT
- A material scientist uploads verified IR spectrum data → rewarded with KMNT
- A writer contributes a tutorial or process description → earns KMNT
- A researcher formulates a fundamental contradiction in a prevailing theory → rewarded with KMNT
- An engineer outlines a recurring but unexplained failure in a robotics subsystem → KMNT earned
- A student documents a gap in public datasets crucial to training climate models → KMNT minted

In addition to these examples, KnowledgeMint is open to any contributions that advance human knowledge in meaningful ways. Whether it’s new data, insights, problem statements, or unique observations, if it holds value, it can be rewarded. The project is designed to adapt to emerging fields, technologies, and disciplines, allowing for continuous expansion of the knowledge base.

## 9. Security & Challenges

- **Spam resistance** — anti-flood mechanisms, AI+human hybrid moderation
- **Plagiarism & forgery** — citation analysis, reputation tracking
- **Governance** — evolving toward DAO with open model scoring

## 10. Future Vision

Imagine a world where knowledge is currency. Creating useful, new information becomes an economic act — and your intellect becomes your income stream.

KnowledgeMint aspires to create this world — one verified idea at a time.

## 11. Join the Experiment

KnowledgeMint is open-source and open-governance. Join us if you’re:
