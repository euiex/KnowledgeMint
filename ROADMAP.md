# 🗺️ KnowledgeMint Roadmap

This document outlines the sequential development plan for the KnowledgeMint protocol. It reflects our step-by-step vision to build a decentralized knowledge-based economy where AI mints tokens for verified human insight.

---

## Phase 1: Concept & Foundations

- Define the core philosophy of knowledge-backed currency
- Develop the initial whitepaper
- Draft high-level system architecture
- Identify criteria for evaluating knowledge (novelty, usefulness, justification)

---

## Phase 2: Prototype Development

- Create proof-of-concept AI evaluation model
- Build minimal web-based user interface for knowledge submissions
- Develop command-line interaction tool (CLI)
- Design a basic token economy model

---

## Phase 3: Smart Contracts & Blockchain Layer

- Implement token minting smart contract
- Enable IPFS-based knowledge storage
- Integrate wallet support (MetaMask or similar)
- Launch on testnet for internal validation

---

## Phase 4: AI Assessment Engine

- Expand AI models for content scoring and contextual analysis
- Build a modular validation pipeline
- Integrate generative knowledge tools (LLMs)
- Enable feedback loop for rejected submissions

---

## Phase 5: Governance & Decentralization

- Implement community curation mechanisms (DAO-lite)
- Open source the evaluation criteria and scoring algorithms
- Allow community proposals for improving validation logic

---

## Phase 6: Network Growth & Ecosystem Expansion

- Introduce reputation scoring for contributors
- Support external knowledge sources and oracles
- Onboard early adopters (researchers, educators, engineers)
- Launch ecosystem incentives and grant programs

---

## Phase 7: Long-Term Vision

- Integrate with other decentralized protocols (e.g., Polkadot, Filecoin)
- Enable knowledge tokens to be used in wider DeFi or educational systems
- Evolve the AI from validator to collaborative knowledge synthesizer
- Promote KnowledgeMint as an alternative to proof-of-work/stake paradigms
