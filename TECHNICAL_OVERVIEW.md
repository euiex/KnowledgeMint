# 🛠 Technical Overview — KnowledgeMint

## Overview

KnowledgeMint is a modular, decentralized platform that tokenizes validated knowledge. The system’s core is an AI agent that both evaluates user-submitted content and actively generates or supports research initiatives. This document outlines the technical components of the platform.

## System Architecture

### 🔁 Modular Components

1. **Knowledge Evaluation Service (KES)**
   - API for content ingestion (text, files, models)
   - Uses NLP + contextual similarity + factuality checks
   - Outputs: scoring + explanation + validation token

2. **Knowledge Grant Engine (KGE)**
   - Actively scans submissions, open data, and scientific sources
   - Identifies impactful work deserving of tokenized grants
   - Auto-generates funding proposals & mints tokens

3. **Reputation Layer**
   - Tracks user credibility
   - Used for weighted validation and governance input

4. **Tokenization Contract (L2 Smart Contract)**
   - Mints tokens via validated hashes
   - Handles governance, grant distribution, decay logic

5. **Decentralized Storage**
   - IPFS or Arweave for storing validated content
   - Ensures permanence and auditability

6. **Governance DAO**
   - Proposals and voting on:
     - Evaluation models
     - Validation criteria
     - Tokenomics policy

## Workflow

### Submission

```plaintext
User → [API Gateway] → [KES] → [AI Evaluation] → [Score + Validator] → [Smart Contract] → Mint Token
