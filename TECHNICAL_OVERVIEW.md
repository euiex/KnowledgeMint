# Technical Overview

KnowledgeMint is a decentralized system for knowledge-based token emission. It leverages AI to evaluate and reward the contribution of valuable knowledge artifacts, including data, models, problems, and theoretical insights.

## 1. System Purpose

To enable the minting of cryptocurrency (KMNT) in exchange for verifiable, valuable knowledge using AI as the minting authority. It provides a third alternative to Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake: Proof-of-Knowledge.

## 2. Key Components

- **Submission Interface**  
  Web or CLI interface for submitting knowledge artifacts.

- **AI Evaluation Engine**  
  Assesses submissions based on novelty, utility, and justification. Also evaluates problem definitions.

- **Minting Logic**  
  Creates blockchain transactions when a submission meets criteria.

- **Blockchain Layer**  
  Stores wallets, token balances, and minting history. Can be built on Ethereum L2 or as a standalone chain.

## 3. Core Concepts

- **AI as Active Agent**  
  The AI is not just a validator but an active innovator — it can generate new concepts, suggest optimizations, assist in research, and create educational content.

- **Knowledge as Currency**  
  Valuable knowledge artifacts and well-defined problems can be exchanged for KMNT tokens.

- **Problem Submission**  
  The system rewards contributors not only for solutions but for bottlenecks and contradictions that hinder progress.  
  _We buy your problems._

## 4. Evaluation Criteria

### For Artifacts:

- **Novelty** – Measured via semantic similarity and source comparison
- **Utility** – Real-world relevance and applicability
- **Justification** – Supporting data, citations, or evidence

### For Problems:

- **Clarity** – Is the problem clearly and unambiguously defined?
- **Impact** – Would solving it unlock innovation?
- **Urgency** – Is it currently blocking development?

## 5. Output

If a submission passes evaluation, a minting transaction is created, issuing KMNT to the contributor.

## 6. Roles

- **Contributors** – Provide data, models, documentation, theories, and problems.
- **AI Engine** – Curates and evaluates.
- **DAO (future)** – Oversees the rules of evaluation and governance.
