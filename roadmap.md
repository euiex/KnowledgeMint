# KnowledgeMint Roadmap

## Phase 1: Concept & Ideation (Q2 2025)
- Define core concept: Proof-of-Knowledge as a new model for crypto token emission
- Draft whitepaper and gather feedback from early contributors
- Form a small team of researchers, AI experts, and blockchain developers
- Establish the basic architecture for the AI evaluation system

## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (Q3 2025)
- Develop the first version of the knowledge submission interface
- Implement a basic AI evaluation algorithm based on novelty and value detection
- Integrate with an existing blockchain (e.g., Ethereum L2, Polygon) for token issuance
- Issue the first KMNT tokens for experimental knowledge submissions

## Phase 3: Prototype Development (Q4 2025)
- Expand AIâ€™s evaluation capabilities with deeper learning models
- Improve the user interface for knowledge submission and wallet management
- Open beta testing with early contributors and collect feedback
- Implement a basic governance model (DAO) to allow community input on AI evaluation criteria

## Phase 4: Testing & Launch (Q1 2026)
- Perform extensive testing to ensure robustness, scalability, and security
- Launch official KnowledgeMint platform with full token economy
- Open the protocol for public knowledge contributions
- Introduce social features to allow users to connect and collaborate

## Phase 5: Community Development & Expansion (Q2 2026)
- Launch marketing campaigns to attract researchers, engineers, and creators
- Expand tokenomics to include NFTs for unique knowledge submissions
- Improve DAO governance and community engagement
- Develop strategic partnerships with academic institutions, tech startups, and research organizations

## Phase 6: Scaling & Future Growth (Q3 2026 and beyond)
- Scale the AI to handle large volumes of knowledge submissions
- Integrate with additional blockchain platforms to diversify token utility
- Implement new features based on community feedback (e.g., cross-platform knowledge exchange)
- Expand globally and explore opportunities for the protocol in emerging industries (e.g., education, healthcare, research)

> The future of KnowledgeMint will evolve alongside the growth of the open knowledge economy.
