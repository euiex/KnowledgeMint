  <h1>KnowledgeMint: Whitepaper</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>KnowledgeMint</strong> is a protocol for decentralized knowledge valuation and token emission. It introduces a novel method of minting tokens in exchange for verifiable, useful knowledge — such as models, data, ideas, or schematics — evaluated by a hybrid AI-human peer validation process. Unlike systems based on mining, staking, or time commitment, KnowledgeMint rewards meaningful intellectual contribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    The core metaphor is simple: knowledge is minted. That is, useful knowledge functions as a form of value and enters circulation by being expressed, validated, and indexed. But unlike purely symbolic or speculative tokens, these are rooted in something verifiable and utilitarian: knowledge objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    KnowledgeMint does not attempt to define what knowledge is universally. Instead, it builds an infrastructure to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Submit knowledge objects for evaluation</li>
    <li>Estimate their utility using AI-based ranking systems</li>
    <li>Validate them through structured peer review</li>
    <li>Issue tokens reflecting that value</li>
    <li>Enable open access to validated knowledge through indexing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In this way, KnowledgeMint proposes a system where the creation and sharing of useful knowledge becomes a first-class economic activity, tracked and rewarded in an open and transparent way.

    Knowledge is not scarce — but attention, structure, and semantic anchoring are. KnowledgeMint is one possible architecture to address that gap.
