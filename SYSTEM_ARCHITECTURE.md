# 📐 System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the **KnowledgeMint** system. It describes the core components, their responsibilities, interactions, and the data flow throughout the decentralized knowledge-minting platform.

---

## 🧱 Architectural Layers

KnowledgeMint consists of three primary layers:

1. **User Interface Layer**  
2. **AI Knowledge Assessment Layer**  
3. **Blockchain Infrastructure Layer**

---

## 1. 🖥️ User Interface Layer

This is the front-facing interface where users interact with the system:

- **Web App**  
  A web-based interface allowing users to submit knowledge artifacts, propose problems, and view token balances.
  
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
  Provides developer-friendly access to system functions for automation and advanced usage.

- **Wallet Integration**  
  Connects user wallets for token management, contribution rewards, and transaction history.

---

## 2. 🧠 AI Knowledge Assessment Layer

This layer validates and processes the incoming knowledge artifacts:

- **Content Analysis Engine**  
  Evaluates submitted artifacts for structure, language, novelty, and coherence.

- **Knowledge Validation Pipeline**  
  Checks the usefulness and justification of contributions using LLMs and predefined scoring mechanisms.

- **Problem Parsing Module**  
  Decomposes complex user-submitted problems into machine-readable formats.

- **Knowledge Generation Module**  
  Synthesizes new knowledge from existing validated data.

---

## 3. ⛓️ Blockchain Infrastructure Layer

This layer ensures immutability, transparency, and decentralization:

- **Smart Contracts**  
  Manage token minting, verification status, and storage of knowledge hashes.

- **Token Ledger**  
  Stores balances, transaction history, and minting events tied to wallets.

- **Decentralized Storage**  
  Off-chain knowledge data is referenced via IPFS or similar storage networks; on-chain records store metadata and hashes.

## 🔁 Data Flow

[User Interface]
      ↓
[Knowledge Submission]
      ↓
[AI Assessment Layer]
  → Analyze & Score Knowledge
  → Validate / Reject
      ↓
[Blockchain Layer]
  → Store Metadata
  → Mint Token if Validated

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Web UI), Node.js (CLI)
- **AI Models**: LLMs for evaluation (e.g., GPT-4 or open-source alternatives)
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible chain (e.g., Polygon)
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized artifact storage
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts for token minting and verification

---

## 🚀 Future Directions

- 🔗 **Polkadot Integration**: To increase scalability and interoperability.
- 🧠 **Semantic AI Expansion**: Improving the scoring and contextual understanding of knowledge.
- 🧾 **DAO Governance Layer**: Enabling community-based moderation and governance.
