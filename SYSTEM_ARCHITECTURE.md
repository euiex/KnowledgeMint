# SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md

## Overview

KnowledgeMint is a decentralized learning and knowledge management platform that allows users to create, mint, and share knowledge modules as NFTs. Each module is uploaded to IPFS and registered on the Ethereum blockchain. The system is designed to be censorship-resistant, open to contribution, and reward-driven via on-chain incentives.

This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and implementation plan for the KnowledgeMint MVP.

---

## 1. Background

KnowledgeMint was created to address the lack of decentralized infrastructure for sharing and validating educational content. The platform combines Web3 technologies — including smart contracts, NFTs, and IPFS — to ensure trustless storage, authorship verification, and content ownership in the knowledge economy.

## 2. Requirements (MVP Scope)

### Must Have
- Web3 login via MetaMask.
- Creation and minting of knowledge modules (NFTs).
- Storage of content on IPFS.
- Browsing and viewing of existing modules.
- Verified and upgradeable smart contracts (using OpenZeppelin).
- Basic frontend to interact with blockchain functions.

### Should Have
- Tagging and categorization system.
- Preview of content prior to minting.
- Simple voting/upvoting or reputation system.

### Could Have
- DAO-based governance for content curation.
- ERC20 reward tokens for contributors.
- Multilingual content support.

### Won't Have (in MVP)
- Real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs).
- Dedicated mobile application.

## 3. Next Steps

We are currently working on the detailed architecture section, which will include:

- Component overview and PlantUML diagrams.
- Smart contract design and storage schemas.
- IPFS usage patterns.
- Off-chain indexing (optional).
- Deployment and CI/CD strategy.

This document will be updated iteratively as each section is finalized.
